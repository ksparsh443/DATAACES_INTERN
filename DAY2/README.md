For the following task, we have tried implementing a basic classification approach using Python to classify a given set of articles based on some parameters including their content, date, snippet, etc., and then categorizing the same using the category file.
We have also used a CNN approach, which is still having some errors but would be pulled into a working code soon.

CNN:  image classification, CNNs can learn to identify patterns in small regions of an image, such as edges and shapes. These patterns can then be combined to identify larger objects in the image. For example, a CNN could learn to identify the pattern of a cat's eyes and nose, and then use this pattern to identify a cat in an image.

In natural language processing, CNNs can learn to identify patterns in words and phrases. These patterns can then be used to identify different parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. For example, a CNN could learn to identify the pattern of the word "the" and use this pattern to identify the article "the" in a sentence.

CNNs are a powerful tool for a variety of tasks, but they can be computationally expensive to train. This is because CNNs typically require a large dataset of labeled data to learn from. However, the cost of training CNNs has decreased in recent years, and they are now becoming more widely used for a variety of tasks.
