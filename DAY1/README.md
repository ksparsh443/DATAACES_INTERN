In the following document we have tried classifying some of the prominent open source AI models and defined both working and principle for the same. The models feautred in the document are:
GPT
GPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

GPT is still under development, but it has already been used to create a variety of impressive applications, such as:

Chatbots that can hold natural conversations with humans
Text generators that can create realistic and creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
Translation tools that can translate languages with high accuracy
Question answering systems that can provide comprehensive and informative answers to your questions
PyTorch
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library. It is widely used for deep learning research and development, and is also a popular choice for deploying machine learning models in production.

PyTorch is known for its flexibility and ease of use. It allows users to create custom neural network architectures and optimize them for specific tasks. PyTorch is also well-suited for deployment, as it can be used to export models to a variety of formats, including ONNX and TorchScript.

TensorFlow
TensorFlow is another popular open source machine learning framework. It is developed by Google and is used for a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

TensorFlow is known for its scalability and performance. It can be used to train and deploy large neural networks on a variety of hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. TensorFlow is also well-documented and has a large community of users and developers.

Gensim
Gensim is an open source library for natural language processing. It is used for tasks such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embedding.

Gensim is known for its speed and efficiency. It can be used to process large corpora of text quickly and accurately. Gensim is also easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API.
